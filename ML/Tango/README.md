Tango: A Deep Neural Network Benchmark Suite for Various Accelerators
=============

* since the source code & the data is big consider cloning from the source: https://gitlab.com/Tango-DNNbench/Tango

* Add what's isnide GPU source code: https://gitlab.com/Tango-DNNbench/Tango/-/tree/master/GPU in this folder


## To build & run :

* building the applications is straight forwarding, you just need to build _host.cu_ file nvcc command

* all the information can be dfound their Gitlab page (https://gitlab.com/Tango-DNNbench/Tango)
